# Day 6 - Type Ahead

## Notes

- Fetch is built in to the browser, returns a promise
- The "blob" of data that comes back, doesn't know what type of data it is just yet
- Putting variable into regular expression -> can use RegExp object in JavaScript
- MDN docs [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) on RegExp object
  - Two ways to create a RegExp object: literal notation and a constructor
- innerHtml to set the HTML markup: docs [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) on MDN
