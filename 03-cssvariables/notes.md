# Day 3 - CSS Variables

## Notes

- On input, type="range" displays a scrolling range for a user to select.
- Type="color" displays a color picker tool, whatever the default is for the browser.
- Using -- before property names in CSS represents custom properties that contain a value that can be used elsewhere.
  - MDN docs [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
- Data attribute can be added to inputs: 'data-___'
- Data set is an object that contains all the data attributes from a specific element
